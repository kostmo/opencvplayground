KNOWN BUGS:
===========

cvQueryFrame() occasionally freezes


WEIRD BEHAVIOR:
===============

When Quit is clicked, we exit cleanly.
When the X button is clicked, it calls the same routine, but exits with a segfault.  ???


When the pipline "add_button" menu is activated, we get an invalid reference passed to the "deactivate" callback
